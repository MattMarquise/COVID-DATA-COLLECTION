# COVID-DATA-COLLECTION:

### OVERVIEW:
##### This is a website that I began building to gain more information on people from all over the world who have tested positive for COVID-19. it uses HTML, CSS, some JS, and PHP. Keep in mind it's not fully completed yet and it's just a project as I don't have a real purpose for it.

### USES:
##### This website allows people to take a survey about their experience while testing positive for COVID-19. The data from the survey is then displayed for anyone to view.
